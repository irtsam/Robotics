# Robotics
This is a robotics project for robot dispatching controller. The files description is as follows:
1. Robot Code: This is an arduino code for the robot with an Arduino microcontroller controlling the motors, GPS compass, compass module and GSM shield.
2. Route_Calculation: This is a python code for calculate intermediate coordinate on a road given initial and final coordinates using an OSM file.
3. Main_Controller: This is aain an Arduino file for integrating a fleet of robots with a CPU that helps calculate routes for the robot to reach end users.
